    <!-- Overview -->
    <section id="overview" class="section">
      <h2>What Is a Rapid Rewards–Style Miles Card?</h2>
      <p>A Rapid Rewards–type credit card ties your everyday purchases directly to a frequent-flyer program, rather than generically collecting cashback or flexible points. Every charge earns miles — often combined with miles from actual flights when travelling with the partner airline. </p>
      <p>These miles accumulate in a loyalty account and can later be redeemed for flights, cabin upgrades or partner-carrier itineraries, depending on the airline’s network and award-chart structure.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Earning -->
    <section id="earning" class="section">
      <h2>How Spending and Flying Earn Miles</h2>
      <p>On a Rapid Rewards credit card, standard purchases typically earn a base rate of miles per currency spent. Some categories — like travel bookings, airline tickets or foreign transactions — may earn bonus miles. </p>
      <p>When you actually fly with the partner airline, you also earn miles based on flight distance or fare class, stacking with card-based miles. Welcome bonuses or spend-based promotions can significantly boost your initial balance.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Redeeming & Value -->
    <section id="redeem" class="section">
      <h2>Redeeming Miles — Flights, Upgrades & Partner Routes</h2>
      <p>Miles can be redeemed for award flights, upgrades, or occasionally for partial-cash + mile bookings. The cost in miles depends on route, demand, seasonality and cabin class, with long-haul or premium flights often offering better value per mile than short domestic legs. </p>
      <p>Because seat availability and airline surcharges influence redemption value, it’s smart to be flexible with travel dates and route options when redeeming miles.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>When a Miles Card Makes the Most Sense</h2>
      <p>If you travel regularly — particularly long-haul or international flights — and are comfortable planning around award-seat availability, a Rapid Rewards–style card can provide substantial value. The more you fly, the faster miles accumulate toward free or upgraded tickets. </p>
      <p>However, if you travel rarely or mostly use budget carriers, a generic travel-rewards or cashback card may offer more consistent value without being tied to one airline’s network.</p>
