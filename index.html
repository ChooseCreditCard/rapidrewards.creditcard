          Some airline cards focus on one thing: earning miles quickly. This guide explains how rapid-earn loyalty
          cards turn everyday spending into flights — and what to check before you commit.

    <!-- OVERVIEW -->
    <section id="overview" class="section">
      <h2>What Is a Fast-Earning Airline Loyalty Card?</h2>
      <p>
        A fast-earning airline loyalty card is built to accumulate miles quickly through simple earn rates,
        boosted categories and recurring bonuses. Instead of focusing on luxury perks, these cards aim to
        get you to your next flight or reward faster.
      </p>
      <p>
        They are typically tied to a specific airline or alliance. Miles earned on the card post to that
        loyalty account and can be combined with miles from actual flights.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- EARNING -->
    <section id="earning" class="section">
      <h2>How You Earn Miles on Rapid-Earn Cards</h2>
      <p>Common features include:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-sm text-slate-200">
        <li>Flat earn rate on all spending (for example 1–2 miles per unit of currency)</li>
        <li>Higher earn rates on airline tickets, hotels or transport categories</li>
        <li>Milestone or anniversary bonuses after you spend a set amount</li>
        <li>Extra miles for booking directly with the airline or partners</li>
        <li>Occasional limited-time promotions on selected categories</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The goal is to make mileage accumulation feel fast and visible, especially for people who use the card
        for most everyday purchases.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- REDEEM -->
    <section id="redeem" class="section">
      <h2>Redeeming Miles — Speed vs. Real Value</h2>
      <p>
        Even when miles post quickly, the value depends on how you redeem them. Fast-earning cards often plug into
        the same award charts and availability rules as other loyalty cards.
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-sm text-slate-200">
        <li>Short-haul or off-peak flights may offer good value per mile</li>
        <li>High-demand routes can require more miles or offer poor value</li>
        <li>Taxes and surcharges are usually paid in cash, not miles</li>
        <li>Some programs offer “any seat” redemptions at variable rates</li>
        <li>Upgrades and companion-style tickets can change the equation</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The speed of earning is only one dimension — you still need to look at how easily you can actually use
        those miles for trips you care about.
      </p>

    <!-- WHEN IT MAKES SENSE -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>When Rapid-Earn Airline Cards Make Sense</h2>
      <p>They tend to fit best when:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-sm text-slate-200">
        <li>You mostly fly with one airline or within one alliance</li>
        <li>You can realistically earn enough miles for at least one trip per year</li>
        <li>You value free or discounted flights more than generic cashback</li>
        <li>You are comfortable planning around loyalty-program rules and availability</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you rarely fly or spread your travel across many airlines, flexible bank points or travel-mile cards
        might be easier to use.
