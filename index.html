    <h1>Southwest Rapid Rewards: Points, Companion Pass &amp; Credit Cards</h1>
    <p class="hero-lead">
      Rapid Rewards is Southwest Airlines’ loyalty program. It uses revenue-based pricing, simple points earning and
      one of the most famous perks in domestic U.S. travel: the Companion Pass. This guide explains how points are
      earned, how redemptions work, what elite tiers look like and how credit cards can accelerate your Rapid Rewards strategy.

  <!-- 1. What the program is -->
  <section id="overview" class="section">
    <h2>1. What the Rapid Rewards Program Is</h2>
    <p>
      Rapid Rewards is Southwest’s frequent-flyer program built around <strong>simplicity and flexibility</strong>:
      no traditional award chart, no blackout dates on points bookings when seats are for sale, and free checked bags
      on Southwest itself (subject to airline policy).
    </p>

    <ul class="list">
      <li><strong>Points-based system</strong> with earnings tied to your fare type and spend.</li>
      <li><strong>Revenue-based redemptions</strong> – points needed roughly track the cash fare.</li>
      <li><strong>Elite status</strong> tiers for frequent Southwest flyers.</li>
      <li><strong>Companion Pass</strong> – a powerful benefit letting a companion fly with you for just taxes and fees on eligible tickets.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- 2. How points are earned -->
  <section id="earning" class="section">
    <h2>2. How Rapid Rewards Points Are Earned</h2>
    <p>You can earn Rapid Rewards points via:</p>
    <ul class="list">
      <li><strong>Southwest flights</strong> – points earned per dollar spent, with different multipliers based on fare type.</li>
      <li><strong>Rapid Rewards credit cards</strong> – points on everyday spend, often with bonus categories.</li>
      <li><strong>Hotel, car rental and shopping partners</strong> – where you enter your Rapid Rewards number.</li>
      <li><strong>Dining and online shopping portals</strong> in the Rapid Rewards ecosystem.</li>
      <li><strong>Promotions and bonuses</strong> – time-limited offers to accelerate earnings.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      For many members, a large share of annual points comes from card spend, partner activity and welcome bonuses,
      not just from flying.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- 3. How cards boost earnings -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2>3. How Credit Cards Boost Rapid Rewards Earnings</h2>
    <p>
      Rapid Rewards credit cards are central to many Southwest-focused strategies. Typical benefits include:
    </p>
    <ul class="list">
      <li><strong>Points on every purchase</strong>, with higher earnings on Southwest and travel-related spend.</li>
      <li><strong>Welcome bonuses</strong> that can move you closer to Companion Pass or multiple award trips.</li>
      <li><strong>Anniversary points</strong> that extend value each year you keep the card.</li>
      <li><strong>Progress toward Companion Pass</strong> through card spend (on eligible products and markets).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      For frequent Southwest flyers, holding at least one Rapid Rewards card is often a key part of long-term strategy.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- 4. Redemption categories -->
  <section id="redeem" class="section">
    <h2>4. Rapid Rewards Redemption Options</h2>
    <p>Rapid Rewards points can be redeemed for:</p>
    <ul class="list">
      <li><strong>Southwest flights</strong> – the main and most straightforward use of points.</li>
      <li><strong>Wanna Get Away–type fares and above</strong>, with varying point costs based on fare.</li>
      <li><strong>Other options</strong> – such as gift cards or merchandise through Southwest portals (usually lower value than flights).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Because Southwest uses revenue-based pricing, there are fewer “sweet spots” than in classic award charts —
      but also fewer surprises. When cash fares are low, points prices are generally low too.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- 5. Elite tiers & Companion Pass -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2>5. Rapid Rewards Elite Tiers &amp; Companion Pass</h2>
    <p>
      Rapid Rewards offers elite tiers plus a separate Companion Pass benefit:
    </p>
    <ul class="list">
      <li><strong>A-List</strong> – entry elite tier with priority boarding and bonus points.</li>
      <li><strong>A-List Preferred</strong> – higher tier with stronger bonuses and perks.</li>
      <li><strong>Companion Pass</strong> – allows a chosen companion to fly with you for just taxes and fees on eligible tickets once you qualify, for the remainder of the year and a future period, depending on current rules.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Certain Rapid Rewards credit cards help you inch closer to these thresholds via points-earning and occasional
      promotional shortcuts, making them a crucial piece for Southwest loyalists.
